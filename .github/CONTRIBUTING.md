# Contributing to Tembelan mission

If you feel like you have designed a feature that would fits the goals of this project, you can either open a feature request describing your idea, or fork/clone the repository and create a new branch based on ``master`` only. Once your feature is ready, documented and tested on your side, you can open a Pull Request so we can review your work.

**Opening a Pull Request to any other branch than ``master`` will result in an immediate closing of the PR.**
